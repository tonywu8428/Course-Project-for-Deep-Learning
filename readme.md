### Problem Statement

Dyslexia is a highly complicated neuro-developmental brain disorder characterized by sluggish and inaccurate word comprehension and phonological impairment, affecting about 5-17% of the general population in most global languages and cultures.

Early diagnosis of dyslexia is crucial in preventing lifelong problems. If dyslexia is undiagnosed, students will likely experience significant frustration and esteem issues in school. They are likely to be seen as low-performing students, hindering academic advancement and resulting in lost career options.

Our project aims to address challenges in the early detection of dyslexia by developing a machine-learning model designed to identify if an individual may possess a marker for it. Current methods often rely on subjective evaluations and are time-consuming or expensive brain scan tests. We aim to develop a more objective, efficient approach using a machine learning tool for dyslexia detection through handwriting analysis, which could provide a broader, more accurate assessment.
